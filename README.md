- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seulusoy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cryptography and Information Security.
- From bitslice implemenations to trade-off (time-memory / data-time-memory)
- High performance implementations (platform and method (mode of operation, bitslice/tables) independent)
- I am trying to publish two academic papers.
- You can reach my article on Attacks Mounted against COLM @ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212622001879
- 
- I see all of the below as tools to show my abilities in Cryptography and Information Security.
- They should be useful as libraries or performance, in other case I see them as burden.
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Standard Template Library 
- Multithreading
- Python
- OOP
- Unit Testing
- VHDL
- CUDA
- C++
- 
- ðŸŒ± I am kind of experienced in
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Standard Template Library
- Multithreading
- OOP
- VHDL
- CUDA
- C++
- I am currently learning all (I believe in continues learning)
- 
- At the moment, I am focused on Data Structures and Algorithms.
- My learning path is as following:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Python only enough to solve questions in cryptohack
- C++: At the moment, I don't use OOP but I use other aspects stl and multithreading
- Unit Testing: I don't know why but people seem to be interesting on this topic.
