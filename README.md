- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seulusoy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cryptography and Information Security.
- From bitslice implemenations to  (time-memory/data-time-memory) trade-offs, (Hellman/Rainbow) tables
- High performance implementations
-   Platform Independent
-     CPU
-     GPU
-     FPGA
-   Method Independent
-     Parallel
-     Unrolled
-     Pipelined
-     Bitsliced
-     Tables
- 
- I am working on two academic papers.
- You can reach my published article on Attacks Mounted against COLM @ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212622001879
- 
- I see the below as tools to show my abilities in Cryptography and Information Security.
- They should be useful as libraries or performance, in other case I see them as burden.
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Standard Template Library 
- Multithreading
- Python
- OOP
- Unit Testing
- VHDL
- CUDA
- C++
- 
- ðŸŒ± I am kind of experienced in
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Standard Template Library
- Multithreading
- OOP
- VHDL
- CUDA
- C++
- I am currently learning all (I believe in continuous learning)
- 
- At the moment, I am focused on Data Structures and Algorithms.
- My learning path is as following:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Python only enough to solve questions in cryptohack
- C++: At the moment, I don't use OOP but I use other aspects stl and multithreading
- Unit Testing: I don't know why but people seem to be interesting on this topic.
